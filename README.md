# fishingTracker
A Bash Script I made a while back to help me quantitatively discover the best method by which to fish, to compile over decades.

I have no direct interest in writing a book over these discoveries to come, but I was merely interested.  I haven't worked on it much since I wrote it many, many months ago, but it functions as it should!  Still, there may be updates to give.  I also started an iPhone App equivalent in XCode, so if I ever finish that, or a version in Python, I will share that as well!

If, for any reason, you would like to donate- though unneccesary, is always apreciated!

Thank you all for reading!

# Update, 4Jan2020
It's been a while, but I'm translating this app over from Bash to Python.  I will then be hosting the app alongside a webserver that I will use to collect data from fishers all over.  I'm in the very early stages, but I've uploaded the parts I've just begun.  More to come soon!
