# fishingTracker
A Bash Script I made a while back to help me quantitatively discover the best method by which to fish, to compile over decades.

I have no direct interest in writing a book over these discoveries to come, but I was merely interested.  I haven't worked on it much since I wrote it many, many months ago, but it functions as it should!  Still, there may be updates to give.  I also started an iPhone App equivalent in XCode, so if I ever finish that, I will share it as well!

Thank you all for reading!

## Update, 6Jan2021
This application is now available as a Python script.  Cheers, everybody!  ðŸŽ‰
